# Minesweeper - Code Challenge

[Code challenge](https://github.com/deviget/minesweeper-API/tree/23ff6b614ee33d5a9104a3ade5f287eee583640b) 
for [Deviget](https://www.deviget.com/).

The project has an API developed in Django, and a UI developed in VueJS.

It uses environment variables for configuration. A full list of available values can
be found in the `.env.example` file.

## Game play!!!

You need to register your email! Do not worry, I will not spam you. In fact, I
will never send you any email. You can use a fake one, I do not care.

I am not requesting passwords because passwords are tedious, and who cares if
someone else sees your games, they might even finish them for you ðŸ¥³.

Once you have registered, you can create a new game (use the beautiful select
box I provide) or you can also continue playing your previous games.

But be careful! Timer will not stop! Once you create a game the timer starts
running... ðŸ˜²

I have provided some easy to remember non configurable game names which you
can use to go back to your previous games. **You are welcome.**

You can create boards of up to 100 x 100, but do know that your browser will
complain! I only allow that number so you can see how my recursive uncovering
implementation does not die due to stack overflow!

### Rules!
 - Click on a flag to, well, flag the cell.
 - Click on the check-mark to uncover a cell.
 - Keep going until you win, or explode.

## Development

### Requirements
- Python 3.8
- Poetry
- Node 14.5
- Yarn

### Django

To run the development server:
```shell
poetry install
poetry shell
# MANUALLY create your own .env file
dotenv python manage.py runsslserver
```

### VueJS

To run the development server:
```shell
cd mineswepper_ui
yarn install
# MANUALLY create your own .env file
yarn serve
```

### Tests

There are some tests for Django, and none for Vue.

#### Why?

Since the data is handled in the backend, tests were implemented there
to ensure that the logic of the game and the data was correctly handled.

Test coverage is incomplete, but my main goal was to show how I write tests.

### API documentation

You can read the API documentation in at two different paths:

- /swagger/
- /redoc/

Choose the one that makes you happier!
